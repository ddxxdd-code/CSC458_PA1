CSC458 PA1

This is a course project of CSC458, completed in groups.

The copyright of starter code belongs to the teaching team.

Copying and submit as your own work is an academic offence if this, unfortunately, is one of your own assignment.

Computer networks is an interesting course while implementing the code in a simulated router is plenty of fun.

There are other possible extensions to this project, including adding support for other protocols, run the router in a more complex topology, or give your router the functionality of Firewall, NAT, etc.
