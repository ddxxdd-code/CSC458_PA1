CSC458 PA1

This is a course project of CSC458, completed in groups.

The copyright of starter code belongs to the teaching team.

Copying and submit as your own work is an academic offence if this, unfortunately, coincides with one of your assignments.

Computer networks is an interesting course while implementing the code controls a simulated router is plenty of fun.

There are other possible extensions to this project, including add support for other protocols, run the router in a more complex topology, or give your router the functionality of Firewall, NAT, etc.

Please contact me if making this repository public is inappropriate.

Have fun!
